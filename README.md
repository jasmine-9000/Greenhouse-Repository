# Database Creation

Use a SQLlite database for testing.

First, install SQLAlchemy.
```
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
In your python application, you need to import this:
```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy.
```

In your application object, specify your database path in your 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' variable in your config class.

```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = ''# your path.
```
Then, in your __init__.py file, initialize your database, like this:
```python
db = SQLAlchemy(app) # app the name of your application that you created in your __init__.py file, and db is the name of the database object you want to create.
```python
now, in the python terminal, while located in the website directory:

Call this series of commands:
```python
>>> from flask_greenhouse import db # flask_greenhouse is the name of your application.]
>>> db.create_all() # this creates your database if you haven't done so yet.
```
This creates all your databases.

Testing Python database commands:
```python
>>> from flask_greenhouse.models import BMSDataentry # or whatever model you're using.
>>> json_received = {"language": "python", "framework": "flask"}
>>> entry_1 = BMSDataentry(json_content = json_received)
>>> db.session.add(entry_1)
>>> db.session.commit()
```

To query the database from a fresh python terminal, run these commands:
```python
>>> from flask_greenhouse import db
>>> from flask_greenhouse import BMSDataentry
>>> BMSDataentry.query.all() # or whatever query you want. read the flask docs for more information.
```
