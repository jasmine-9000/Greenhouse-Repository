notes:


In the components document:

add a summary
how 
how will it be used?
who is the audience? Who will benefit from this document?

thesis has to be a literate college-level discussion


Master schematic:

Have a summary of the schematics.
This document contains a complete description of ....

discuss the significance of each of these schematics.

What's existing, what's not existing?

Put stuff in the title block
Put a brief statement in the title block describing what's in the schematic.

Started 

Begin writing a Pro's document.

turn this into a report.

When you think it's complete, turn it into a report style document.

In the introduction, introduce what's in the schematics?

Discuss each page in turn. What's in there, why is it important, and how does it relate to the design a 

We can turn it

***
Make it very clear on the schematic what's existing and what's proposed.

Don't necessarily 

Proposed vs existing?

In my written summary of this page, 

These are figures.

Single page figures.

Example;

Page 3: all of these represent existing stuff 

On thi



Get this into a professional summary form.


***
When can we meet next so we can document what's existing, and what's proposed. 
***


Make it so


Components left:

The mechanical box that contains all the parts.
	Have a set of pictures that document where things are located.

The yellow and black switches.

	Use GIMP to annotate pictures of the greenhouse.

	Corrolate them to my schematic.

	Correlate these into my schematic.

The heater and coolers required for the battery box.

Student microcontrollers

Use some way to identify components. Arrows, maybe?

I could try doing it in MS word.

Produce relevant details. Use it as a working document of what's actually there.

Then make recommendations.

Older notes:

	Take physical measurements.
	Confirm wiring.
	Identify mystery box.


********************

Action items:

get my documents completed.
	- Items: components doc, and schematics doc.
	- written introductions and discussions about how to use them!
	- kind of a report! turn them into working documents.
	- pictures can go into the components document.
complete the component list!
future: review with Tela. As soon as she gets back from vacation!
get pictures that we can review.
get documents that we can read.
identify what I plan to add to the greenhouse. (specify additions to the greenhouse)
put some of the additions 
in my components document, list out existing vs proposed components separately.

have an existing vs proposed schematic. 

take the same document, and add proposed additions separately.

If it fits in the same document, we could put them both in there.
