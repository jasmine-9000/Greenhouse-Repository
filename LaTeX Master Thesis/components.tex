\section{Solar Panels}
% adapted from the MS word document.
\subsection{Introduction}

This is a client request. These solar panels let certain wavelengths of light through them, and absorb the rest of the spectrum. This allows plants to grow inside.

\section{Charge Controller}
\subsection{Introduction}

Solar panels cannot charge batteries directly for these reasons: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item They have unstable voltages, and thus should not be connected directly to the battery. 
	\item Batteries with different chemical compositions charge differently. 
	\item One solar panel cannot provide enough power to the battery alone, even if it reaches the nominal voltage of 12V. 
	\item If we string 12 solar panels in series together and plug it into the batteries, the batteries will become permanently damaged.
\end{itemize}

Solar panels cannot charge batteries properly by themselves. We must have a charge controller to accompany the solar panels in order to charge the batteries properly. I like the TS-MPPT-60 because it is custom-programmable, and it can monitor a significant amount of values that could be useful someday. I included the values it can monitor below.

	\item Maximum 150V solar panels in series
	\item Keyholes for mounting
	\item Uses TrakStar MPPT technology to track the maximum power point of the solar panels.
	\item Temperature compensation
	\item Two Tristar Morningstar MPPT’s can be attached to the same battery pack
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Drawbacks}

The internal PLC settings can only be changed with a PC that can run MSView, Morningstar’s proprietary program that can program any Morningstar device, that can be downloaded from Morningstar’s website, located here:\\

\href{https://www.morningstarcorp.com/msview/}{https://www.morningstarcorp.com/msview/}\\

It can only handle 150V of solar panels. We have 24 solar panels, which in series total to a nominal voltage of 192V. Therefore, we must have at least 2.

\section{Batteries}

\subsection{Lithium-ion Battery Cell}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Solar panels do not produce power all the time. Even when they do produce power, they often don’t produce enough power to satisfy the consumer. During the day, when the solar panels produce the most power, the consumer often isn’t using the system. To resolve this, we need to have a battery pack. During the day, the battery pack will be charged by the solar panels, and during the evening, the battery pack will be discharged by the consumer.\\

\section{Sensors – Faculty}
\subsection{Introduction}
The client wants their own sensors exclusive for faculty. They want to measure temperature, humidity, and light. I propose that we use these classes of sensors for this:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Temperature and Humidity Sensor
	\item Light Sensor
\end{itemize}
The product page for the parts and their respective datasheets will be hosted by different companies. This is because it is easier to order a breakout board than it is to order the individual parts, order a custom PCB for the sensor, and solder the parts onto the board. Companies that sell breakout boards and companies that manufacture parts are separate from one another.

\section{Faculty Microcontroller}

\subsection{Introduction}
In every computer system, there must be a main processor. In this greenhouse system, a master microcontroller is utilized to harvest data, process it, and send it to a main server somewhere on campus. See the website manual for details on how it’s processed there. The main microcontroller must be able to communicate with the Faculty Sensors somehow, and communicate with the slave microcontrollers when we implement them. I have chosen to interface the main microcontroller with the slave microcontrollers via Bluetooth. Bluetooth is wireless, and easy to program. Does not require any wires running across the greenhouse floor, and reduces tripping hazard. So, our Microcontroller  has these requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Must be capable of sending packets of data over a 2G internet connection to a server somewhere at UCSC.
	\item Must be capable of communicating over Bluetooth to a slave microcontroller somewhere in the greenhouse.
	\item Must be capable of reading I2C data.
\end{itemize}

\par
The microcontroller I have chosen for this job is the Raspberry Pi Model 3B+. It is a capable microcontroller. It runs Linux on its systems, so it’s easy to debug on site if necessary. The code can be stored on an SD card. If necessary, it will be possible to retrieve a log of the past 30 days of data from the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi Raspbian system uses a FAT32 file system, meaning the absolute maximum amount of data it is possible of addressing is 32GB. So, it should be enough for at least 30 days worth of data. But, the SD card also has to store the operating system it will use (Raspbian). 
\par
This microcontroller uses a +5V power source. Therefore, we will have to design a power source for it. The tolerance values for the microcontroller are tight: it only accepts +4.5V to +5.5V. It can draw up to 2A of current when running a stress-test. So, let’s just say it draws a maximum of 10W of power.

\subsection{Recommended Accessories}

\subsubsection{Sixfab’s GSM/GPRS shield}

I don’t like the FONA module. I would like to replace it. I would like to instead use this GSM/GPRS shield. It slides easily onto the master Raspberry Pi, and can also fit another shield onto it if so desired. I will be fabricating a faculty sensor shield utilizing the I2C protocol. This shield utilizes the UART protocol. The Raspberry Pi can only accommodate 1 use of the UART protocol using the GPIO pins. The others will be using the Virtual COM ports of the Raspberry Pi. The Tristars will be using a RS-232 to USB converters with an FTDI chip installed in them for communication, and the BMS system will be using a split-open USB wire that will connect directly to the BMS control unit.\\

\subsubsection{Custom-fabricated I2C shield for Raspberry Pi}

Will be custom-designed at home here at UCSC. Will be rushed, though. If I find a design, will be using it. Will have these features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Capable of holding at least 8 I2C devices

\section{Student Microcontroller}

\subsection{Introduction}
Instead of having every student plug into one microcontroller (which would require a lot of cables running around), I propose that for every experiment, we have a separate microcontroller that the student can take with them. The Raspberry Pi 3 Zero W is a great candidate for this. It’s Bluetooth enabled, so they aren’t burdened by a cable length. It’s just as powerful as the normal Raspberry Pi, with the addition of writing their own code for their own sensors. \\
 \\
We will have to use our own sensor shields.

\end{itemize}

\section{Heater - Battery Pack}
\subsection{Introduction}

All battery packs must have a heater. When batteries get too cold, there is a possibility of permanent damage to the batteries, and an unnatural reduction of life cycles might occur. There is no heater for the battery pack currently on-site, but here is my proposal: install a heater for wherever the batteries are stored. The heater will be controlled by a relay, which will be controlled by the BMS system. The BMS system has temperature sensors on-board to tell when the batteries are getting too cold. \\

\section{Cooler – Battery pack}
\subsection{Introduction}

We should be burying our batteries underground to protect against warmer temperatures (according to forum rumors). If the batteries have an excessive load, they become at risk for overheating. If the batteries are overheated for too long, they will become permanently damaged. We must have a cooler for our battery pack to cool the batteries. I propose we install a fan or a radiator. The air underground usually stays at least 25 – 30 C, so we can use that air to cool the batteries. \\
 \\
I don’t have a solid choice of cooler yet, but this is my best choice so far: \\

\section{Web Server}

Website link: arboretum-backend.soe.ucsc.edu/ (user requested) \\
Server Location: somewhere at UCSC. It's hard to tell. 
Who to call when things go bad: Heidi. This is an unsupported virtual machine, so we are on our own. Try referencing the Website Troubleshooting section of this document first. \\

\section{Power Conversion}

\subsection{Introduction}
All our microcontrollers that we are using need +5V to operate properly. Our batteries distribute power in +12V packages. Therefore, we need a way to convert that power reliably.
\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tolerance ranges: +4.5V to +5.5V
	\item Ends in a Micro-USB plug
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{}
We can either design a DC-DC voltage converter ourselves, or we could try to get one from a commercial retailer and hope it has good enough tolerances for our Raspberry Pi. Either way, we must have a DC-DC voltage converter.
I propose that we get one from a commercial retailer. That way, if there are any malfunctions with it, we don’t have to build another one ourselves, we can simply buy another one from the same retailer.
